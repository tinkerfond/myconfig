    -  Command

    -  Size substitutions with differences
    -  Font shape

    - No \printglossary or \printglossaries found.

### Float related gimmicks
All floating objects are automatically centered and set to `H` as position with other objects.

### Table related gimmicks
#### L
A new column type is given `L`, that allows for automatic mathmode in column.

TODO: Add usage example!

### Theorems related gimmicks
All theorems are in `definition` style, meaning that they are not in *italic*.

Proofs are treated as theorem environments.

The following theorem-like environments are provided: 
- theorem
- corollary
- lemma
- proposition
- observation
- definition
- complexity
- property
- problem
- proof

### Lists related gimmicks
- Lists are built to be more compact and leave less blank space.
- Using the environment `todolist` it is possible to create checklists.

TODO: Add todolist example.

### Additional gimmicks
- When a page is empty, Latex won't generate page number or other page elements.
- When you want to leave a blank line you can just leave a blank line, without adding `\\`.
- If you'd like to use roman numerals there a command for that: `\rom{your number goes here}`.
